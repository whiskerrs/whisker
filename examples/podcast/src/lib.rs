//! Podcast browser — production-layered Whisker example.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Composition root only. Real work lives in the sub-crates:
//!
//! ```text
//! podcast-theme               ← design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing)
//!                                no deps; pure consts
//! podcast-domain              ← Podcast / ChartSection value types
//!                                no deps; pure types + serde
//! podcast-data                ← iTunes Search API client + repositories
//!                                depends on: domain, ureq, serde
//! podcast-ui-kit              ← reusable atomic widgets
//!                                depends on: whisker, theme, domain
//! podcast-feature-browse      ← Browse screen (sections + cards)
//!                                depends on: whisker, theme, domain,
//!                                            data, ui-kit
//! podcast-feature-detail      ← Show detail screen
//!                                depends on: whisker, theme, domain,
//!                                            ui-kit
//! ```
//!
//! The top-level crate (this one) owns the [`AppRoute`] enum, the
//! [`RouteStack`] that drives screen-to-screen navigation, and the
//! shared [`PodcastIndex`] context. It also publishes a
//! [`Navigator`] context so the feature crates can call `show_detail`
//! / `go_back` without depending on `whisker-router` directly —
//! keeps Browse and Detail unaware of the routing layer.
//!
//! Adding a new screen later (Now Playing, Library) means a new
//! `podcast-feature-*` crate, a new [`AppRoute`] variant, and a
//! match arm in the `StackLayout`'s `render` closure here — plus a
//! method on `Navigator` to push it.
