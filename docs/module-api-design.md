# Module API Design Guide

How to choose the user-facing shape for a new Whisker module crate
(`whisker-audio`, `whisker-image`, `whisker-notifications`, …) so it
slots into the rest of the framework instead of becoming a new
five-th paradigm.

This doc covers the **shape**: which Rust surface to expose to the
app author, and why. For the **mechanics** (how the crate is laid
out, and how Kotlin / Swift wire to Rust through the bridge), scaffold
a crate with `whisker new-module`, read the reference module
[`whisker-local-store`](../packages/whisker-local-store/), and see the
crate-graph / bridge overview in [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md).

> **Audience.** Authors of new module crates, and reviewers of new
> module PRs.

> **Distribution is crates.io-only.** A module is one ordinary crate
> published to crates.io. There is **no** SwiftPM Registry or Maven
> Central entry per module — the native Swift / Kotlin sources ship
> *inside the crate tarball* via the `include` list in `Cargo.toml`
> (`ios/**/*.swift`, `android/**/*.kt`, `Package.swift`,
> `build.gradle.kts`). The iOS / Android builds extract them from the
> downloaded crate. So your module's whole public contract — Rust
> surface *and* native code — lives behind a single `whisker = "0.1"`
> + `whisker-yourmodule = "0.1"` in the app's `Cargo.toml`.

## TL;DR

Whisker ships five surface shapes for platform-bridging APIs. Match
your module to the shape that fits its semantics and stop:

| Shape | Looks like | Example | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **Component** | `<Image src=… />` | `whisker-image`, `whisker-svg`, `whisker-icons` | Pure native UI widget with no imperative methods |
| 2. **Component + ref-bound handle** | `<Video ref:=h.r() />` + `h.play()` | `whisker-video` | UI widget that *also* needs imperative methods |
| 3. **Clone value-type handle** | `Player::new(url)` + `.play()` + `.status()` | `whisker-audio` | Native resource without a view, with lifetime + observable state |
| 4. **Free fn returning a signal** | `safe_area_insets() -> ReadSignal<…>` | `whisker-safe-area` | Singleton environment observable (viewport, network, battery) |
| 5. **Static methods / free fns** | `WhiskerLocalStore::save(k, v)` | `whisker-local-store` | Stateless one-shot operation |

The rest of this doc walks the decision and explains why each shape
exists.

In words:

1. **Render pixels?** → it's a component.
   1a. With imperative methods? Shape 2 (handle attached via `ref:`).
   1b. Pure declarative? Shape 1.
2. **Lifetime detached from UI?** → Shape 3 if observable, Shape 5
   if stateless.
3. **Process-wide singleton observable?** → Shape 4.

## The two macros, and the native side

Every shape below uses one of two Rust-side macros:

- `#[whisker::module_element(name = "package:Name", ...)]` — declares a
  **Host view** element and its portable schema for `render!`. The element
  name is explicit, stable, and versionless. Shapes 1 and 2 use it.
- `whisker::module!("Name")` — resolves a **function module** handle
  (`PlatformModule`) you `.invoke(method, args)` / `.on_event(...)` on.
  Shapes 3, 4 and 5 build their typed wrappers over it. The name is
  likewise crate-namespaced to `<crate>:Name`.

There is **no** `#[whisker::platform_module]` attribute — function
modules are plain Rust wrappers over `module!`, not macro-generated.

The matching **Host** half is written with the `definition()`
`ModuleDefinition` DSL. A module subclass overrides `definition()` and returns
a `ModuleDefinition { Name(...); View(...); Prop(...); Command(...) }` block.
Android KSP and the iOS build plugin only discover and register these handwritten
definitions; they do not generate their contract. The Rust schema and Host
definition are independently compiled and matched by strings at bootstrap.
Desktop and Web use ordinary Rust Host crates with the same definition shape.

Android/iOS use `Function` and `AsyncFunction` only at module level. A
`View` block exposes one-way `Command`s and cannot declare `Function` or
`AsyncFunction`. Observable component state travels through props and events;
a genuinely service-like request belongs on a module-level function. Web/Desktop
use the same vocabulary through their Rust builders. `Prop` always has separate
set and clear callbacks, and all values are `WhiskerValue`. A `TextStyle` hook
receives the resolved inherited text style. A synchronous `Measurement` hook
returns an intrinsic size or reports the request unsupported.

```swift
// iOS — packages/whisker-local-store/ios/.../LocalStoreModule.swift
public final class LocalStoreModule: Module {
    public override func definition() -> ModuleDefinition {
        ModuleDefinition {
            Name("WhiskerLocalStore")
            Function("save") { (args: [WhiskerValue]) -> WhiskerValue in /* … */ }
            // view modules add `View(WhiskerImageView.self)` + `Prop("src")` here
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Shape 1 — Pure Component

```rust
#[whisker::module_element(
    name = "whisker-image:Image",
    measurement = ReplacedContent,
)]
pub fn image(src: Signal<String>, mode: Signal<ImageMode>, style: whisker::Style) {}
```

```rust
// Usage
render! {
    Image(src: "https://…", mode: ImageMode::AspectFill, style: css!(width: px(200)))
}
```

**When:** the module renders a native UI widget whose state is fully
captured by its props. The app never needs to call methods on it
imperatively — re-render with different props is enough.

**Why a component:** the platform widget needs to live inside the
element tree (so it inherits layout, gets sized by flex, paints in
the right z-order). Props are `Signal<T>`, so a reactive `src` swap
re-fetches the image without a remount.

**Lifetime:** tied to the parent owner. Unmount happens when the
parent component disposes, cascading through Whisker's reactive
scope tree.

**Reactive:** props are individually reactive. No `status()` signal —
there's nothing to observe.

**Examples:** `whisker-image::Image`, `whisker-svg::Svg`,
`whisker-icons::Icon`.

---

## Shape 2 — Component + ref-bound handle

```rust
#[whisker::module_element(
    name = "whisker-video:Video",
    measurement = None,
    commands = [("play", Null), ("pause", Null), ("seek", Float)],
)]
pub fn video(src: Signal<String>, style: whisker::Style) {}

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
pub struct VideoHandle { r: ElementRef }

impl VideoHandle {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn r(&self) -> ElementRef;     // attach via `Video(element_ref: handle.r())`
    pub fn play(&self) { let _ = self.r.command("play", WhiskerValue::Null); }
    pub fn pause(&self) { let _ = self.r.command("pause", WhiskerValue::Null); }
    pub fn seek(&self, secs: f64) {
        let _ = self.r.command("seek", WhiskerValue::Float(secs));
    }
}
```

```rust
// Usage
let video = VideoHandle::new();
render! {
    View {
        Video(element_ref: video.r(), src: "clip.mp4", style: css!(height: px(200)))
        View(on_tap: move |_| video.play()) { Text(value: "play") }
    }
}
```

**When:** the module renders a native UI widget *and* needs imperative
methods (`play`, `pause`, `seek`, `focus`, `scrollTo`, …). These are
actions the user triggers in response to a tap or other event — not
declarative state that a re-render can capture.

**Why a separate handle:** the methods need to dispatch through the
mounted element. Whisker exposes `ElementRef` for exactly this
shape — the handle is `Copy` (just a slotmap key) so it copies freely
into `on_tap` closures.

**Lifetime:** the *handle* is just a key; constructing one before the
element mounts is fine (methods no-op until `element_ref:` binds). The
*native player* tracks the mounted element and is released when the
element is unmounted by its owner.

**Reactive:** *optional* — a Shape-2 module can expose a `status()`
reactive signal if it has observable state worth binding (see
[#128](https://github.com/whiskerrs/whisker/issues/128) for
`whisker-video`'s pending decision on this).

**Examples:** `whisker-video::Video` / `VideoHandle`.

---

## Shape 3 — Clone value-type handle

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Player { /* Rc-backed */ }

impl Player {
    pub fn new(source: impl Into<String>) -> Self;
    pub fn play(&self);
    pub fn pause(&self);
    pub fn seek_to(&self, s: f64);
    pub fn status(&self) -> ReadSignal<PlaybackStatus>;
    // …
}
```

```rust
// Usage
let player = Player::new("clip.mp3");
let status = player.status();
render! {
    Text(value: computed(move || format!("{:.1}s", status.get().position)))
    View(on_tap: { let p = player.clone(); move |_| p.play() }) {
        Text(value: "play")
    }
}
```

**When:** the module owns a native resource (audio player, network
socket, watchdog timer) that:

1. has no visual representation of its own (no element in the tree),
2. has a lifetime independent of any one UI element (can outlive a
   tab change, can be shared between two unrelated views),
3. has observable state worth binding (`position`, `is_playing`,
   connection state, etc.).

**Why a Clone handle:** the native resource needs a Rust-side owner
to release it. `Clone` lets the handle live in multiple closures
without back-channel coordination. Internally it's `Rc<Inner>` so
the native side releases on the last drop.

**Lifetime:** ref-counted on the Rust side. The native resource
releases when the last `Player` clone drops — typically when the
component that owns the source clone unmounts and the scope
disposes.

**Reactive:** `status() -> ReadSignal<T>` is the canonical entry
point. The signal is process-global, dispatched per-player-id; all
clones of the same handle see the same signal.

**Examples:** `whisker-audio::Player`.

---

## Shape 4 — Free fn returning a signal

```rust
pub fn safe_area_insets() -> ReadSignal<SafeAreaInsets>;

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub struct SafeAreaInsets { pub top: f64, pub leading: f64, /* … */ }
```

```rust
// Usage
let insets = safe_area_insets();
let padding_style = computed(move || {
    format!("padding-top: {}px", insets.get().top as i32)
});
render! { View(style: padding_style) { … } }
```

**When:** the value is a **singleton observable** for the whole
process — environment metadata that has one canonical answer at any
moment (safe-area insets, keyboard height, network reachability,
battery level, dark-mode state, …). The app doesn't construct it; it
just *observes* it.

**Why a free function:** there's nothing to construct, name, or
keep distinct copies of. A `Hook`-style call is the most direct
expression.

**Lifetime:** the underlying signal is process-global, lazily
initialised on the first call via `OnceLock`. It stays alive for the
process — never disposed.

**Reactive:** *the whole point* — the function returns a
`ReadSignal<T>` directly.

**Examples:** `whisker-safe-area::safe_area_insets`.

---

## Shape 5 — Static methods / free fns

```rust
pub struct WhiskerLocalStore;

impl WhiskerLocalStore {
    pub fn save(key: String, value: String) -> Result<bool, WhiskerModuleError>;
    pub fn load(key: String) -> Result<Option<String>, WhiskerModuleError>;
    pub fn remove(key: String) -> Result<(), WhiskerModuleError>;
}
```

```rust
// Usage
let _ = WhiskerLocalStore::save("user_id".into(), "abc".into())?;
let loaded = WhiskerLocalStore::load("user_id".into())?;
```

**When:** the operation is **stateless and one-shot** — fire it,
get a `Result`, done. No identity to carry across calls. No
observation worth binding.

**Why static methods (or free functions):** the unit struct
`WhiskerLocalStore` is a namespace, nothing more. The functions
could be free `whisker_local_store::save(…)` — it's a style
preference; the unit-struct form lets the rustdoc page render the
operations grouped under one heading.

**Lifetime:** none.

**Reactive:** none. If the caller wants to *react* to the underlying
state changing (e.g. someone else wrote to the same key), they
should poll via a `resource()` — but that's the caller's concern,
not the module's.

**Examples:** `whisker-local-store::WhiskerLocalStore::{save, load,
remove}`.

---

## Why these five and not "one true shape"

Whisker is **a reactive Rust runtime atop a native UI layer**. Each
shape exists because the underlying constraint shape is different:

| Constraint | Implication |
|---|---|
| Native UI widgets must live in the element tree | Shape 1 / 2 — they have to be components |
| Native resources have lifetime, observable state, and Rust-side ownership | Shape 3 — Rust handles + `Rc` are the right primitive |
| Some natives are singleton process-wide observables | Shape 4 — a free fn returning a signal removes ceremony |
| Some operations are pure side-effecting calls | Shape 5 — wrapping them in a handle would be noise |

### Why not "everything is a component" (React-style)

React fits when the platform composes from a single primitive — DOM
nodes. Whisker bridges to native widgets *plus* native resources
*plus* environment observables. Forcing audio playback into a
`<Player src=…>` mount means:

- The `Player` lifetime is now tied to where in the tree it's mounted
  — moving the mount point unmounts + remounts (re-fetch, lost state).
- The handle has to be passed back out via `ref:` (Shape 2), which is
  exactly Shape 3 plus an irrelevant element.
- Sharing one player between two tabs becomes a context-provider
  ceremony.

### Why not "everything is a hook" (React-with-only-hooks-style)

Hooks fit singleton observables (Shape 4). For multi-instance
resources (two players running in parallel, two open camera
sessions) you need value identity — distinct `Player` handles. Hooks
return values keyed on call-site, not value-keyed, so they don't
naturally compose for the multi-instance case.

### Why not "everything is a free fn" (Solid-without-Owner style)

Free functions work for Shape 4 / 5 but lose lifetime semantics for
Shape 3. `play()` and `pause()` need to know *which* player —
that's a handle, not a function.

The five shapes are the *minimum* set; anything fewer and one of
those constraint axes gets paved over.

---

## Anti-patterns

When reviewing a new module crate, flag these:

### Anti-pattern A: Component for what's actually Shape 3

> "Let's mount a `<Audio src='clip.mp3' is_playing=true />` and toggle
> `is_playing` via a signal."

Symptoms: the prop set keeps growing (`is_playing`, `position_seek`,
`volume`, …); each one needs back-channel coordination to know when
to fire. Lifetime is tied to the mount point, so unmounting breaks
playback.

Fix: make it Shape 3 (`Player::new + play() + pause()`).

### Anti-pattern B: Shape 4 for multi-instance state

> "`use_player(url)` returns a `ReadSignal<PlaybackStatus>` for that
> URL."

Symptoms: re-calling `use_player` with a new URL is ambiguous —
new player, or new subscriber to the same one? Two components want
two different players; can the hook give them distinct instances?

Fix: make it Shape 3 (value identity is in the handle).

### Anti-pattern C: Shape 3 for stateless ops

> "`let store = LocalStore::new(); store.save('k', 'v');`"

Symptoms: `new` doesn't do anything meaningful; the user has to
think about lifetime where there is none.

Fix: make it Shape 5 (`WhiskerLocalStore::save`).

### Anti-pattern D: Shape 5 for observable state

> "`get_safe_area_insets() -> SafeAreaInsets` — call it again to get
> a fresh value."

Symptoms: callers poll in a `resource` or `effect`, races with
native event delivery, miss updates.

Fix: make it Shape 4 (return a `ReadSignal<T>` so updates are
push-based).

### Anti-pattern E: Mixing shapes within one module

A module that exposes *both* `Player::new(url)` *and* a
`<Player src=…>` element is two APIs for the same thing — confusing
and prone to drift. Pick one.
